Using android studio,i was able to create to do list app which has a launcher page as the splashactivity and sign up and sign in pages

Under the app/java folder,u get to see the adapter and signinactivity,signupactivity as well as main activity

The recycler item touch helper was effective in updating, deleting and editing new tasks.
